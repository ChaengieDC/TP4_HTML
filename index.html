        <h3>Dreepy</h3>
        <div class="article">
            <img src="img/dreepy.png" alt="Dreepy" class="image">
            <p>Dreepy is a small, green Pokémon resembling a reptile or amphibian. Its head is a darker green, with yellow eyes, pink eyelids and gills, and large horns tipped with pink. Its serpentine body has two long front limbs, as well as a darker green stripe near its tail with three fins surrounding it.<br>
                Dreepy are reborn ghosts of a prehistoric species that once lived in ancient seas. It generally retains the same behaviors it had when it was alive, as it tends to wander the locations where it once lived, as well as biting at Clauncher as if to eat them.<br>
                Dreepy are exceptionally weak in combat, so much that on its own, a mere child could defeat it. However, it has the potential to become much stronger and evolve if it has friends to help it train. In the evening, groups of Dreepy fly at high speeds across the seas, poking at other Pokémon underwater for fun.<br>
                Dreepy can often be seen fighting alongside its evolutionary relatives Drakloak and Dragapult. The former takes care of Dreepy until it evolves, while the latter is known to launch Dreepy at Mach speeds, which the Dreepy enjoy.</p>

        <h3>Flaaffy</h3>
        <div class="article">
            <img src="img/flaaffy.png" alt="Flaaffy" class="image">
            <p>Flaaffy is a pink, bipedal, ovine Pokémon. It has thick, conical ears with black stripes on the sides of its head and small, blue eyes. A white mane of wool covers its head and upper body. This mane forms sideways curls on the top of its head.<br>
                It has stubby arms and one nail on each foot. Flaaffy's long tail has black stripes and is tipped with a blue orb.<br>
                Storing too much electricity caused Flaaffy to lose the wool over most of its body, but the bare, rubbery skin protects it from the electricity stored in its fleece. The quality of Flaaffy's fleece can change to generate more electricity with less wool.<br>
                The orb will light up when Flaaffy's mane is fully charged, and it can attack by firing electrified hairs at opponents.<br>
                Flaaffy typically inhabits grassy meadows and fields, though it can also be found in farms, where its wool is used to create high-quality clothing.</p>
